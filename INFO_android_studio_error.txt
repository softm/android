# Write access is allowed from event dispatch thread only --> (File -> Project Structure -> SDK Location)
    So the problem was concluded in that android studio conflicted with my installed jdk version, 
    so it was resolved when i checked jdk location (File -> Project Structure -> SDK Location), 
    ticked 'Use embedded JDK' checkbox and set jdk location to 'path to android studio'\Android Studio\jre

    The android default libraries like appcompact, design support libraries are stored in your folder where you have installed the SDK, precisely <SDK FOLDER>/extras/android/m2repository/com/android .
    The 3rd party libraries are stored in .gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1 folder.
    The gradle folder is hidden. In linux you can find it in your home directory by pressing ctrl+h which helps to view hidden files and folder.
    In windows it is present at C:\Users\UserName\.gradle
    e.g if you are using butterknife library then in above path there will be a folder get created as com.getkeepsafe.relinker, inside that folder you will find its related folders and files, .aar or .jar files.
